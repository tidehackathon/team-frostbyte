## 1.1.Scrapping
To acquire information from the TIDE platform, the solution in the Downloader directory must be utilized. It is imperative that the resulting data adheres to the appropriate folder structure for each year as established within the repository, with the option to generate these folders automatically set as default.

Pages needed to be downloaded:
1. Test Template
2. Test Case
3. Capability
4. Objectives
5. Focus Areas
6. Nations

#### Important !!!!!
This component do multiple requests in parallel, so be careful to not make a DDOS to tide. 
#### Configuration 
* To change request time, modify the constants MAX_DEGREE_OF_PARALELLISM and DELAY in Utils.cs file (Downloader.Commons csproj).
* In each program.cs file modify the value of username and password used to download data. 
* Uncomment type of object (TT, TC ...) which must be downloaded (Utils.Download method)

#### Requirments
* NET 6 SDK & Runtime;
* IDE;

## 1.2. Parsing
The objective of this application is to extract relevant data from HTML pages and subsequently generate JSON files that conform to the corresponding JSON schemas for each type of entity, namely TT, OB, CC, among others. In addition, the application aims to correlate entities by performing a search for the same identity of a particular entity across multiple years.

As part of its functionality, the application also includes a feature to rectify formatting errors that may arise due to incorrect standards provided by users on CCs pages. This ensures that the resulting JSON files are accurate and comply with the appropriate formatting guidelines.

* The parsing process is split in 2 sets of scripts, developed in 2 different technologies. It is organized as a .NET project, but for each year, there are .NET components and in the scripts folder, the python parsers can be found.

#### Important steps
* extract information from HTML pages and converting it into JSON. 
* establish a correlation between entities, by searching across multiple years for instances of the same identity associated with a particular entity;
* Fix formatting errors, like incorrect standards written by users in CCs pages;

#### Configuration
* There is no need for any additional configuration.

#### Run
* compile & run the .net project for desired cwix cycle;
* at present, the Python scripts do not have an auto-run feature. Therefore, to execute the code, methods must be manually invoked from the main function.

#### Requirments
* NET 6 SDK & Runtime;
* IDE;
* Python

## 1.3. Normalize
The normalization utility serves the purpose of converting and parsing JSON normalized data, establishing correlations with other relevant entities, rectifying errors, and precomputing relevant indicators and KPIs.
The utility provides a command-line interface that allows users to choose from a selection of available steps. When opend the fallowing prompt will be presented to user:

#### Configuration
* In the Tide.Normalizer project, the file appsettings.josn is available for configuration;
* Change the path to point to the location where data is stored;
* Change the array with cwix years. Note that years must be written in the yy format;
* Change the connection string so it points to a MSSQL server where the database is deployed.

#### Run
* compile & run the .net project;
* use the GUI to enter options;

#### Requirments
* NET 6 SDK & Runtime;
* IDE;

## 1.4. Web 
This utility is designed to provide users with a user-friendly web-based platform for accessing data from the data store. Its primary objective is to enable the plotting of data in a visually engaging and easy-to-interpret manner, thereby facilitating enhanced understanding and decision-making.

#### Configuration
* In the Tide.Dashboard project, the file appsettings.josn is available for configuration;
* Change the path to point to the location where data is stored;
* Change the array with cwix years. Note that years must be written in the yy format;
* Change the connection string so it points to a MSSQL server where the database is deployed.

###$ Run
* compile & run the .net project;

## 1.5 Database
To create the database, the instructions outlined in script.sql must be executed. It is essential that the stored procedures are created, as they play a critical role in the enhancement process.

# 2. Usage example
* Utilize the data provided in section 1.1 to acquire a cycle's worth of data from the TIDE portal. Expected result : html files;
* Normalize all entities (CCs, TTs, TCs, etc.) using the parser, taking care to employ both C# (for TCs and FAs) and Python scripts (for the rest). Expected result : .json files for all entities;
* Establish correlations between entity identities across multiple cwix cycles using the correlation functions available in the Python scripts.
* Create database;
* Execute Tide.Normalizer and proceed with the steps numbered 1 through 10 to ensure the import of all relevant data. It is essential to ensure that the script is configured correctly, as outlined earlier.
* Execute the fallowing stored procedures from sql, in this order : enh_tt_maturity, enh_tt_tc_count, enh_tt_anomalies, chart_all_tt_year_anomalies;
* Execute the steps numbered 11 through 13 to establish data correlations.
* Execute the fallowing stored procedures from sql : enh_obj_tc
* Run web project and explore the pages. For the moment, menu is not published:
  * capability page : /capability?capabilityId= X  -> where X is any id from dbo.Capabilities table;
  * nation page : /nation?nationId= X -> where X is any id from dbo.Nations table;
  * multidomain page : /multidomain
  * anomalies page : /anomalies
